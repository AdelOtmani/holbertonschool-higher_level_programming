 How to Use 4-print_square.py
===============================

This library is very simple, since it only has one function called
``print_square()``.

Numbers
=======

``print_square()`` print first and last name (last name = "" by default).

::


    >>> print_square = __import__('4-print_square').print_square

    >>> print_square(4)
    ####
    ####
    ####
    ####

    >>> print_square(1)
    #

    >>> print_square(0)

    >>> print_square(-1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: size must be >= 0

    >>> print_square("a")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: size must be an integer


    >>> print_square(2.3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: size must be an integer
